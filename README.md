## Pacific-Australian Plate coupling along New Zealand: determined from velocity calculated by Kostrov Summation Method 

- Used Python for data management (CMT data zonation), the calculation (velocity and strain rate), and 3D data plotting.
- Applied Linux shell script (mttk) for Kostrov Summation Method
- Made use of Linux GMT to create map plots (focal mechanisms and velocity vector)
