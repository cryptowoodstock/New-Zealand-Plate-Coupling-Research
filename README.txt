Hello there! I hope you are staying positive and testing negative!!
---
This directory contains codes essential for analysing the area and producing diagrams. The moment tensor summation code (Moment tensor .ipynb) is in the Python code directory. Data used in the code can be found in the Data directory. 
---
If you want to analyse New Zealand in 2D and 3D slice, you can check out Plotly.ipynb in the Python code directory.
---
If you want to analyse New Zealand in detail, I suggest you check out zone 1-13 analysis.ipynb. In which you can obtain 3D plot of the region, moment tensor sum, velocity, strain and frequency magnitude plots.
---
If you want to see all parameters (such as velocity and strain rate of each region), check out Summary.xlsx in the Excel spread sheets directory.
